# Summer Internship II: IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate  

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
As part of my Summer Internship, I enrolled in the **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate** program on Coursera. This certification consists of **13 structured courses** covering Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Generative AI, and AI Agents.  

So far, I have **completed the first 6 courses (~104 hours)**, which form the **foundation track** in ML and DL. Through these modules, I gained both theoretical understanding and hands-on experience in building AI models using **Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch**.
